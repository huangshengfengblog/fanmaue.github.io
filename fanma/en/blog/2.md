## 1.0 Create directory

Create blog and note subdirectories under fanma's directory to classify and store md files for easy management in the future.

```sh
mkdir fanma
mkdir fanma/blog
mkdir fanma/note
```

## 2.0 create a file

Create some md files, and create a README.md file under each directory as the main page of the directory.

```sh
echo '# Hello FanMa' > fanma/README.md
echo '# Hello FanMa' > fanma/blog/README.md
echo '# Hello FanMa' > fanma/blog/2.md
echo '# Hello FanMa' > fanma/note/README.md
echo '# Hello FanMa' > fanma/note/1.md
```

## 3.0 Number of articles

In order to enrich the article information and bring better experience to reading. We add the word count function to the article, modify the content of the theme. ts file, and add the following code to the theme. ts article.
```ts
pageInfo:["Author", "Original", "Date", "Category", "Tag", "ReadingTime","Word","PageView"],
```

## 4.0 Website author

Or in the theme. ts file, find the location of the author, and change the name to the name of the author of your website.

```ts
export default hopeTheme({
hostname: "https://fanma.eu.org",
author: {
name: "饭吗",
url: "/",
},
iconAssets: "iconfont",
```

## 5.0 default language

Find the lang setting in locales in the config.ts file. "/" indicates the default setting of the website. After we change the lang: "en US" in "/" to lang: "zh CN", the default language of our website will become Chinese. It is worth noting that the following "/en/" should be changed to "/zh/", and the zh-CN should also be changed to lang: "en US". The title: "Fanmo Blog" is to set the title of the website, that is, the website name. Fill in Chinese in the Chinese language, and fill in English in the English language column. (lang: "zh CN"=Chinese, lang: "en US"=English)

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  base: "/",

  locales: {
    "/": {
      lang: "zh-CN",
      title: "饭吗博客",
      description: "一个饭吗的博客网站",

    },
    "/en/": {
      lang: "en-US",
      title: "FanMa",
      description: "A Blog for FanMa",
    },
  },
```

## 6.0 Modify Navigation

After changing the default language to Chinese, we also need to modify the relevant parameters of the navigation bar at the top of the page. Find the. vuepress  navbar  zh.ts file and change "/zh/" to "/". There are also links where the relevant/zh/should be removed, such as link: "/zh/demo/" to link: "/demo/".

```ts
export const zhNavbar = navbar([
  "/zh/",
  { text: "案例", icon: "discover", link: "/zh/demo/" },
  {
    text: "指南",
    icon: "creative",
    prefix: "/zh/guide/",
    children: [
      {
        text: "Bar",
        icon: "creative",
        prefix: "bar/",
        children: ["baz", { text: "...", icon: "more", link: "" }],
      },
      {
        text: "Foo",
        icon: "config",
        prefix: "foo/",
        children: ["ray", { text: "...", icon: "more", link: "" }],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    text: "饭吗笔记",
    icon: "note",
    link: "/category/博客笔记/",
  },
]);
```

The following is the final modification effect of the. vuepress  navbar  zh.ts file:

```ts
export const zhNavbar = navbar([
  "/",
  { text: "案例", icon: "discover", link: "/demo/" },
  {
    text: "指南",
    icon: "creative",
    prefix: "/guide/",
    children: [
      {
        text: "Bar",
        icon: "creative",
        prefix: "bar/",
        children: ["baz", { text: "...", icon: "more", link: "" }],
      },
      {
        text: "Foo",
        icon: "config",
        prefix: "foo/",
        children: ["ray", { text: "...", icon: "more", link: "" }],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    text: "饭吗笔记",
    icon: "note",
    link: "/category/博客笔记/",
  },
]);
```

Of course, the relevant en.ts file should also be modified according to the above method to be able to browse the relevant web pages normally. So our language-related settings are ready. Finally, we need to delete the zh folder of the main directory. Of course, you can keep it. Then create another en directory, and create a corresponding README.md file under the en directory, which is the home page of the English website.
