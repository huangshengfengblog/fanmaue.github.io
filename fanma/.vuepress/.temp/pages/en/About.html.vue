<template><div><p>FanMa's Chinese name is Fanma, and its name is the transliteration of a branch of the Guangxi Yao language family. There are several languages of the Yao language family. In fact, I don't know which language family I belong to. The languages of different languages of Yao dialect are different from each other. I listen to Yao dialect of other languages at all.</p>
<p>FanMa blog is built with VuePress static website generator, which is a website framework program without service backend. Because the official default theme of VuePress is too simple, I chose [VuePress Theme Home]（ <a href="https://theme-hope.vuejs.press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://theme-hope.vuejs.press<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> ）This theme has a built-in blog plug-in, which makes it easier for me to write a blog.</p>
